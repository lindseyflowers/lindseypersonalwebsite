<center><h1>Sample Cover Letter</h1></center>
<h3>The following is a sample cover letter I submitted for an internship I received an offer for for the summer of 2016. It showcases the general format and style of my standard cover letters. In it, I make sure to showcase why I'm interested in the organization, why I'm qualified, and thank them for the oppurtunity to apply for the position.</h3>

<p> Dear Ms. Boothroyd, </p>

<p>I want an internship where I will be able to not only practice my public relations skills and writing, but where I will be actively doing some good. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society not only supports a cause close to my heart, but your social media and public relations position would allow me to do real, meaningful work.</p>

<p>I have spent my years at Virginia Tech honing my public relations skills via challenging classes, organizational involvement and a previous internship. I enrolled in courses that had me writing and designing a campaign for a local farmers market, improving my technical writing, honing my editing and planning hypothetical campaigns. The skills I practiced would be applicable when writing newsletter articles, updating public calendar content and corresponding with donors and members of your organization. I headed the campus Women Center publicity and marketing committee, regularly releasing content to promote the organizations initiatives and programs. During the summer of 2015 I was the communication and social media intern at the Homeless Childrens Playtime Project, a non- profit in Columbia Heights. I acted as the interim communication manager while they were in between managers; I had to be very motivated and create my own schedule and work. I regularly updated their social media with news and relevant articles, wrote blog posts, managed their website and contacted volunteers and donors. This combined experience prepared me for interning and joining the National Multiple Sclerosis Society team.</p>

<p>I want to do public relations for a non-profit or community-minded organization, and interning with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society would a great way to continue my career and gain valuable experience. My experience with PR writing and professional field would make me a valuable asset the organization. I will be excited and available to work with your team from early May to late August. Thank you for taking the time to consider me, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
